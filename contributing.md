# Contribution Guidelines

Hello, and thank you for wanting to contribute to the project! We're always open
to any suggestions, ideas, insights and improvements from anyone, and this page
is our small brochure with few tips, advises and requests from us to you we made
in order to help you get the most out of your suggestion.

Before continuing further though, please read [our Code of Conduct.][2]

## What we welcome

We're open to all sorts of suggestions (issues or pull requests), but with few
exceptions (including, but not limited by):
* Do not suggest anything that adds features heavily deviating from main purpose
  of the submod (adding unrelated topics, starting up other programs, etc.)
* Do not suggest full rework of the submod (instead, try pointing out flaws
  and missing features)

## How to suggest changes

### In issues

Issues are a great way to submit your general ideas and suggestions without a
need to code just anything &mdash; we'll take care of it ourselves, or someone
else willing to contribute will, too!

If you want to share your ideas in issues, you can do it [here.][1]

### In pull requests

Pull requests are a way to submit change proposals to the existing codebase. In
order to do that, you should fork this repository first, make your changes and
commit them and then create a new pull request.
