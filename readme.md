## üåü Features

  * Windows, Linux and MacOS &mdash; all supported!
  * Auto-start switch flip that isn't immersion breaking &mdash;
    ask your Monika to enable or disable it through 'Hey, Monika...' menu!
  * Already have autostart enabled somehow? Submod is able to detect some of the
    common approaches and will hook into it if possible.


## üí° Things to note

Due to how this mod is made and how it interacts with system, there are few
things to keep in mind:

  * It might take from few seconds to one or two minutes for MAS to start up
    after computer has booted up. This is highly OS-specific and unfortunately
    there isn't anything we really can do about it. Please be patient, game will
    start as soon as OS will decide it can start.
  * In order for autostart to work, you must have DDLC.exe/DDLC.sh files intact
    in your DDLC folder and you must not rename or move them.
  * Likewise, the game won't get launched on start if you'll move it elsewhere;
    however, autostart entry will be overwritten on next manual game launch.
  * On Windows, your system must have VBScript engine and be able to run .vbs
    files (some users may have it removed for their own reasons.)


## ‚ùì Download and install instructions

### Step by step instruction

If you understand it easier with video guide, jump to next section.

  1. Download latest release from [releases page](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-autostart/releases/latest)
     (scroll down to 'Assets' section and select first `.zip` file.)
  2. Extract `game` from `.zip` package into your DDLC folder (folder that contains
     `DDLC.exe` file.)

     ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT!**
       * **DO NOT** unpack archive *into* `game`!
       * **DO NOT** unpack archive *into* `Submods` folder!

         The only thing you should do is to drag and drop `game` from archive into
         DDLC folder and let your OS *merge folders* for you on its own.
       * **MAKE SURE** you have `DDLC.exe` file in your DDLC folder if you are
         using Windows; Linux users must ensure their `DDLC.sh` script is not
         renamed too; MacOS users *usually* don't have to worry about that, but
         in case any sort of problem arises, check if `DDLC` file in `MacOS` folder
         inside DDLC.app package is present and not renamed.
  3. Start the game and enable random chatter &mdash; in order to see enable/disable
     topics in 'Hey, Monika...' menu, you'll have to see random intro topic first.
  4. (Optional, but highly recommended) Install [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)
     to be sure you always have latest version of MAS Autostart Submod.

## üîß Troubleshooting

* Check if you this submod is installed in `game\Submods\MAS Autostart Mod`
  folder, **case-sensitive**!
* Check if you have `DDLC.exe` (Windows), `DDLC.sh` (Linux) and
  `DDLC.app/MacOS/DDLC` (MacOS) files! If you have them renamed, your OS won't
  be able to launch MAS on start.
