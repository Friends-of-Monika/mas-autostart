## 🌟 Features

  * Windows, Linux and MacOS &mdash; all supported!
  * Auto-start switch flip that isn't immersion breaking &mdash;
    ask your Monika to enable or disable it through 'Hey, Monika...' menu!


## ❓ Download and install instructions

  1. Download latest release from [releases page](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-autostart/releases/latest)
     (scroll down to 'Assets' section and select first `.zip` file.)
  2. Extract `game` from `.zip` package into your DDLC folder (folder that contains
     `DDLC.exe` file.)

     ⚠️ **IMPORTANT!**
       * **DO NOT** unpack archive *into* `game`!
       * **DO NOT** unpack archive *into* `Submods` folder!

         The only thing you should do is to drag and drop `game` from archive into
         DDLC folder and let your OS *merge folders* for you on its own.
       * **MAKE SURE** you have `DDLC.exe` file in your DDLC folder if you are
         using Windows; Linux users must ensure their `DDLC.sh` script is not
         renamed too; MacOS users *usually* don't have to worry about that, but
         in case any sort of problem arises, check if `DDLC` file in `MacOS` folder
         inside DDLC.app package is present and not renamed.
  3. Start the game and enable random chatter &mdash; in order to see enable/disable
     topics in 'Hey, Monika...' menu, you'll have to see random intro topic first.


## 🔧 Troubleshooting

* Check if you this submod is installed in `game\Submods\MAS Autostart Mod`
  folder, **case-sensitive**!
* Check if you have `DDLC.exe` (Windows), `DDLC.sh` (Linux) and
  `DDLC.app/MacOS/DDLC` (MacOS) files! If you have them renamed, your OS won't
  be able to launch MAS on start.
